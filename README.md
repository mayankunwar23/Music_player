# Music Player Design

This is a simple **Music Player** design built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The player allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a song's playback, and displays basic song information and progress. It features a clean and minimalist design with interactive controls.

## Features

- **Play/Pause** functionality with dynamic icon change.
- **Progress Bar** to track and update the song's current time.
- **Audio Controls** to play, pause, and navigate forward/backward in the track.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- **Custom Styling** for buttons, sliders, and icons.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple music player interface that showcases the use of:

- HTML5 audio elements (`<audio>` tag) to play music files.
- JavaScript for controlling playback and updating UI elements like the play/pause icon and progress bar.
- CSS for styling the user interface, with focus on mobile responsiveness.

## Demo

You can try out the project by opening the `index.html` file in any modern browser. It will display the player interface, and you can interact with the buttons to play/pause and control the music.

## Installation & Setup

To set up the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **A web browser** (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) to view and interact with the project.
- **Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to understand and customize the code if needed.

### Local Setup Steps

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**

   - To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:
   
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-player-design.git
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can download the zip file from the repository and extract it to a folder on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   
   Open your file explorer (or terminal) and navigate to the folder where you downloaded or cloned the project.

3. **Add Your Song Media:**

   - In the `media` folder, you'll see a file named `song.png` for the album art and `Despacito_320(PagalWorld.com.sb).mp3` for the music track. Feel free to replace these with your own media files (make sure to use proper file extensions).
   - If you're using different song files, make sure to update the file paths in the `index.html` accordingly.

4. **Open the `index.html` File:**

   - Open `index.html` in your web browser. The music player interface should load up, and you should be able to play and pause the song.

### File Structure

```bash
music-player-design/
│
├── index.html           # The main HTML file for the project
├── style.css            # The CSS file for styling the music player
├── script.js            # JavaScript file for interactive functionality (inlined in the HTML)
├── media/               # Folder containing media files (e.g., images and audio)
│   ├── song.png         # Album art
│   └── Despacito_320(PagalWorld.com.sb).mp3 # Music track
└── README.md            # This file
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and semantics of the music player.
- **CSS3**: For the styling of the UI elements, including buttons, sliders, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, including play/pause functionality, progress tracking, and control updates.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in the navigation and control buttons.

## Customization

You can customize the music player by:

- **Changing the Song**: Replace the `src` attribute in the `<audio>` tag with your own music file.
- **Changing the Album Art**: Replace the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag with your own album art image.
- **Styling**: Modify `style.css` to change the look and feel of the player (e.g., background color, button styles).
